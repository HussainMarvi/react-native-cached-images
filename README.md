# react-native-cached-images

CachedImage component for react-native

This folk is TEMPORARY, orginal from [react-native-cacheable-image](https://github.com/jayesbe/react-native-cacheable-image)

Package react-native-cacheable-image is outupdate, it depends on react-native-fetch-blob and now package react-native-fetch-blob is no longer support so this folk move depends to rn-fetch-blob.

## Installation

    npm install react-native-cached-images --save
    - or -
    yarn add react-native-cached-images

We use [`rn-fetch-blob`](https://github.com/joltup/rn-fetch-blob) to handle file system access in this package and it requires an extra step during the installation.

_You should only have to do this once._

    react-native link rn-fetch-blob
